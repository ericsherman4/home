                            <p>I am currently working towards a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering (expected to graduate in August 2023). So far, I've kept a 3.98 GPA and earned the First Year Success Award, a spot on Dean's List, and Honors Academic Standing.</p>
                            <p>Through coursework and internships, I've learned to use C++, C (including unit testing using C frameworks), Python, ARM-Cortex-M MCUs (ST, NXP), LabVIEW, MATLAB, Linux, STM32CubeIDE, Git, Confluence, and Jira. I also have experience in CAD software like Altium Designer, Fusion 360, LTSpice, and fabrication tecniques such as 3D Printing, soldering, and populating PCBs. I've also picked up some automation skills such as PLC and HMI programming.</p>
                            <p>Currently, I'm back at school (who would have thought this day would come) after being an intern for 16 months. I just completed my extremely exciting summer internship at SpaceX working on manufacturing automation. You can also check out some of the other places I've worked in the past <a href="#work">here</a>.</p>
