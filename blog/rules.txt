Formatting
1.  A newline character will start a new <p> tag.
2.  If a path to an image is detected and it is a valid path, then it will be converted to html.
    A blank line is required before and after the image URL.
    The image URL must begin by accessing the image folder, i.e "images/path_to_image"
3.  Number 2 also applies with videos.

Input/Output
1.  The input will be a plain text file.
2.  The output will be an html file containing the converted html. The html file should be able to open in the browser with all of the styling included.
